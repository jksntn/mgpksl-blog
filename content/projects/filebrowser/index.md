File Browser (formerly known as File Manager) provides a file managing interface within a
specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit your files.
It allows the creation of multiple users and each user can have its own directory.

This software can be either used as a standalone application or as a middleware. It was also
implemented as a Caddy, a lightweight, fast, general-purpose, cross-platform HTTP/2 web server
with automatic HTTPS, [plugin](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.filebrowser).
